### 🚀 About Me

I’m a computer science grad who codes because I genuinely enjoy it.

I'm always exploring, always improving, and always building.

### 🧩 Values I Don't Compromise On

- **🧍 Honesty**: I believe in clear communication, honest feedback, and staying grounded — in code and in life.
- **🧭 Integrity**: I build with care, always aiming for solutions that are thoughtful and sustainable be it in my code or my relationships.
- **🛠 Resilience**: When things break (and they do), I stick with it, learn, and improve.
- **🔥 Passion**: I truly enjoy what I do — and that’s what keeps me going.
